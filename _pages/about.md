# About Me

I am a Research Resident under the supervision of [Prof. Trung Le](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=gysdMxwAAAAJ&hl=vi) and [Dr. Toan Tran](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=PnwSuNMAAAAJ&hl=vi) at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io), Vietnam. I received a Master's degree in Data Science and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2023 and 2021.

My research focuses on machine learning models that emulate human learning, emphasizing generalizability, robustness to adversarial attacks, and the ability to learn continuously from multiple sources. Recently, I have been focusing on model unlearning and model merging.
